Thesis of master

## GameObject
- **RaytracingController** : Handles the setup and execution of ray tracing operations, such as managing light paths and reflections within the game world.
- **WallController** : Manages the behavior, positioning, and properties of walls in the game environment, including interactions and visual updates.

## Script
- **WallManager.cs** : Automates the creation and layout of rooms based on predefined parameters.
- **MonteCarloRayTracingcs** : Implements Monte Carlo algorithms for simulating realistic light reflecting.
- **IntersectionDetector.cs** : Calculate the intersection point of the rays emitted by the four base stations based on the ray information and collision point information
- **IntersectionLogger.cs** : Store intersection information for subsequent viewing and processing
